= MATH 567: Mathematical Techniques in Data Science

Dominique Guillot (EWG 534)

University of Delaware

Spring 2017

MW 5:00PM â€“ 6:15PM, Room: TBA

== Description

The course provides an introduction to the fundamental techniques used
in data science. The main objective of the course is to develop a good practical knowledge and
a mathematical understanding of the common tools that are used to analyse modern datasets.
The course also provides hands-on experience in data analysis through practical homework and
class projects.

== Syllabus

Detailed [./syllabus/MATH567_DataScience-Spring2017_v1.pdf syllabus].

== Textbook

An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. 

The pdf of the book is available for free at [http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/].

== Lectures
