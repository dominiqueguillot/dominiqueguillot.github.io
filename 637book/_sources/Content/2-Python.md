# Setting up Python

There are various ways to use Python for this course. Some popular possibilities include: 
* Google Colab
* Setting up your own local Python environment

## Google Colab

A very simple way to use Python is to run it in the cloud via a service such as Google Colab. No configuration is necessary. You can immediately start writing code once connected to Colab. This is the recommended way for people who are less familiar with Python.  

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and create a new notebook. 
2. Enter 1 + 1 in the first code block.
3. Press Shift+Enter to execute the command. You should see "2" in the next output block.

## Setting up your own local Python environment

If you prefer to run code directly on your own computer, it is highly recommended that you install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download). This Python distribution comes with many useful scientific computing packages pre-installed. 

```{note}
If you are working on a mac, your computer comes with a pre-installed version of Python. You probably do **not** want to use this version as it typically does not include scientific packages that we will need, and installing them can be a headache. It is recommended to use Anaconda if you want to run code directly on your computer. 
```

Once you have Anaconda installed, you probably want to install a nice editor. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
