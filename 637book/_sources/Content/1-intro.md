# Introduction

Welcome to Math 637 online! Please note that this course is fully asynchronous.  

The first few chapters will guide you through what to expect from the course, how to work on assignments, and how to setup a Python environment. 

## Reporting typos and errors

This book is a work in progress. If you notice typos or errors while reading, please report them using this <a href="https://forms.gle/Mx6KdxgfZRc2qrFa9" target="_blank">Google Form</a>. (Please use your @udel.edu email address to access the form.)

## Goals of the course
* Become familiar with the basic methods used to analyse modern datasets.
* Understand the standard models used in data science.
* Understand how to select a good model for data.
* Be able to analyse datasets using a modern programming language such as Python.  

## Level of the course
* No familiarity with data science is assumed. 
* Course will cover a mix of theory and applications. 
* Level of math will vary. 

## Prerequisites
* Probability theory and basic statistics (e.g. MATH 350).
* Multivariable calculus (e.g. MATH 243).
* Linear Algebra (e.g. MATH 349).
* Basic programming background (ideally with Python).

```{note}
If you have no or very little experience working with Python, more effort will be required from your side to get up to speed and be able to progress in the course. The next chapter contains more details about setting up a Python environment and the basic commands you should know.

## Assignments

```{admonition} Assignment
---
class: warning
--- 
The course includes assignments to complete on the associated [Canvas](https://sites.udel.edu/canvas/) page. They are displayed as red boxes throughout the text. While the course is asynchronous, all assignments have **deadlines** to help ensure you make regular progress throughout the semester. Please review the deadlines regularly on Canvas to make sure you don't miss any. 
``` 

## Labs

The course also includes labs that focus on coding and analyzing datasets. In such chapters, please run the commands in your own Python notebook to reproduce the work. Make sure to include comments and add your observations as markdown text. **You will need to submit your lab notebook for credits for some of the labs.** Please make sure you understand all the commands and attend office hours if you need help. You are also strongly encouraged to go beyond the lab content and to explore extensions of the material on your own.

## Exercises

```{admonition} Exercise
Some chapters include exercise boxes in the text. While these are not graded, you are strongly encouraged to work on them to improve your understanding of the material.
